      <h2>The Worldwide Web</h2>
    
        <ul><li>What makes up the entire worldwide web is a collection of <span class="key-term">HTML</span> documents linked together and linked to other files such as videos, text, images, and music</li>
        <li><span class="key-term">HTML</span> (HyperText Markup Language) is the glue that holds the web together</li>
        <li>Connections between pages are called <span class="key-term">HYPERLINKS</span> which is what makes the web, weblike</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Structure of the Web</h2>

      <div class="subtitle">There are 4 major components to the web as we know it today.</div>
      <ol>
            <li> <span class="key-term">Browsers</span> make the web viewable from a personal computer and is that space where users experience the web</li>
            <li> <span class="key-term">HTTP</span> (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the main protocol of the web which allows for the exchange or transfer of hypertext via hyperlinks</li>
            <li> <span class="key-term">The Internet (Cloud)</span> is the world's largest computer network</li>
            <li> <span class="key-term">Servers</span> are stacked computers that host files and html documents that make up the web</li>
            </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>What makes up HTML?</h2>

      <div class="subtitle">There are  4 different components of <span class="key-term">HTML</span>.</div>
      <ol><li>Text Content (what you see)</li>
      <li><span class="key-term">Markup</span> (what it looks like)</li>
      <li>References to other documents e.g. videos, images</li>
      <li>Links to other pages</li>
      </ol>
      
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>What is HTML Markup?</h2>

      <p class="text">Html Markup is made up of <span class="key-term">ELEMENTS</span> that typically contain three parts listed below.</p>
      <ul><li><span class="key-term">Opening Tag</span> which is listed inside brackets sideways carrot brackets like- &lt; &gt;</li>
      <li><span class="key-term">Contents</span> are in between tags</li>
      <li><span class="key-term">Closing Tag</span> is listed inside brackets with an additional slash inside like- &lt;/ &gt;</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="text">Examples of Tags (note: some tags are "void" tags and don't need a closing tag)</p>
      <ul><li>b - bold</li>
      <li>em - emphasis (italics)</li>
      <li>a - anchor (for making links)</li>
      <li>img - image, attribute is src - source (url) and alt - text displays when the server fails to load the page</li>
      <li>br - line break (void tag - no closing tag)</li>
      <li>p - paragraph</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Element Attributes</h2>
          
          <p class="text"><span class="key-term">Attributes</span> are a property of an <span class="key-term">Element</span> that modifys it e.g. href, src, title, etc. <span class="key-term">Attributes</span> are always specified in the start tag and come in name/value pairs like: name = "value"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
        <ul><li>Inline Element - functions in line with the text - e.g. span, strong, img, a, br</li>
        <li>Block Element - actually creates a invisible box that can be modified heighth and width - e.g. div, p, form</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>House Analogy</h2>    
      <p class="text"><span class="key-term">HTML</span> is the structure of a  website, while <span class="key-term">CSS</span> is the interior decorations and <span class="key-term">Java Script</span> is the mechanical parts like a garage door.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>"Boxifying" is Key</h2>

          <p class="text">Everything in <span class="key-term">HTML</span> can be divided into boxes that can be nested inside of other boxes which allows us to create the structure needed. When a front end web developer gets a design for a webpage from a designer the first step is to identify and outline all the boxes on the page, this is what is meant by <span class="key-term">"Boxifying."</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>Need Feedback? - Use a Text Editor</h2>

          <p class="text">Text editors (e.g. Sublime Text) help programmers by doing certain things automatically like displaying exactly what the code that is written looks like and/or gererating closing tags automatically.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>Need More Feedback? - Use Developer Tools</h2>

          <p class="text">Developer Tools deliver immediate visual feedback about the structure and design of a given page. They also teach us about the nested nature of the code and show us the proper way to indent code we write for ease of reading and editing later on.</p>

  <h1 class="lesson-heading">How CSS Helps Avoid Repetition</h1>

    <div class="content">  
    <h2>CSS Defined</h2>    
      <p class="text"><span class="key-term">CSS</span> (Cascading Style Sheets) defines how elements are to be displayed and reduces work by keeping developers from having to repeat adding style code to each individual element in html. <span class="key-term">CSS</span> code is usually stored in separate files with the file extension .css and is linked in the header of the <span class="key-term">HTML</span> document.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
    <h2>Cascading Nature of CSS</h2>

          <p class="text"><span class="key-term">Inheritance</span> is a key property of <span class="key-term">CSS</span> to reduce workload and reduce errors when editing code. <span class="key-term">Inheritance</span> relys on the document structure where parent elements pass on certain traits to child elements such as font, color, or letter spacing. In general only text-related properties can be inherited as opposed to box-related properties (e.g. padding, or margin) This concept helps to avoid errors from repeating steps and also creates consistency in the style of the webpage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>CSS Identifiers</h2>

          <p class="text"><span class="key-term">Identifiers</span> allow for us to specify which <span class="key-term">HTML</span> elements we want to modify and again help us to make consistency in the style of the page and to reduce errors when writing and editing code. One example of this is if we want to reference an element from our <span class="key-term">HTML</span> we specify the element and inside brackets we can change properties of the element like this: h1{...inside here we adjust properties of this element...} Inside the brackets the change to a property of the element is specified like: name: value; (e.g. color: red;)</p>
